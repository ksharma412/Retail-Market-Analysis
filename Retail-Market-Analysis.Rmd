###  1.Introduction

Our research is focused on helping a major retailer know their customers better. The goal of the study is to derive insights from the available 'Customer Full Journey' datasets relating to customers, transactions, and more. As part of our methodology we plan to clean, tidy, explore, and analyze the datasets we received to finally answer the following questions of interest - 

* **Problem Statement #1:** What household demographic factors contribute most to customer spend in the stores? Learn about the most impactful factors affecting customer spending.

* **Problem Statement #2:** What category is each customer most engaged with? Profile customers and their engagement levels with product categories.

<br>

Our methodology can be broadly classified into three steps - 

* **Data cleaning and preparation**: Clean and tidy the tables/datasets in R, and join tables as required for the analysis (more in detail in the section on data preparation)

* **Data Exploration**: Explore the nature and source of data, explore missing values and reasons ; identify abnormal values and outliers, and visualize variable distributions and correlation as required

* **Data Analysis**: We propose a regression analysis (linear modeling) to determine the demographic factors that affect consumer spending the most. This will be followed by a clustering technique to segment and profile customers according to their engagement levels with various product categories inside the store

<br>
This research will help the client in two major ways. Firstly, understand better as to what factors impact the amount of purchase customers make inside stores. Secondly, design better targeted marketing campaigns powered by the knowledge of customer engagement (and spending) levels with various product categories.

### 3.1.Data Preparation - I


**3.1. Data Source**
The original data on the retail client was downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/frtgnn/dunnhumby-the-complete-journey

<br>
 **3.2.1 Introduction of source data**
The dataset primarily tracks the transaction level data from 2,500 households who frequently shop at the client's stores. Moreover, the data captures purchases made across the entire gamut of product categories available at the retailer's stores. Among other important information, we have customer demographics data and direct marketing campaigns data available for certain households. 
(Please Note: The terms 'Customer' and 'Household' have been assumed synonymous and used interchangeably in this report)

Timeline: The data tracks customer transactions over a period of two years (104 weeks).

<br>
**3.2.2 Explanation of source data (tables and variables)**
In total, this comprehensive total customer journey had 8 different data frames. Each of these are described in brief below. Also a small glimpse into each of these data is given below

***Code for Loading Tables***

``` {r, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}

datasets<-c("campaign_desc","campaign_table","causal_data","coupon","coupon_redempt","hh_demographic","product","transaction_data","product_dpt_mapping")
for (i in seq_along(datasets))
{ 
  
  file_path=paste0("D:\\Sem 2 - Spring 2022\\MKTG 886\\Project - Kratika\\data/",datasets[i],".csv")
  if(file.exists(file_path))
  {
    df<-read.csv(file_path)
    assign(datasets[i],df)
  } else
    print("No such file exits")
}

```


* **Transaction data**:
 Variables: This data frame captures all the product purchases done by all households in two years. This data frame has some variables which are of interest to our research question - the sales value, the retail discounts and coupon discounts which will help us arrive at final customer spend for each customer.

``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
transaction_data[1:3,] %>%
kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),full_width = F)%>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")

```
<br>


* **Demographics data**
Shows demographics information on a limited number of households. This will be crucial in solving our problem statement # 1, where we will build a linear model to see what demographic factors affect customer spend.  

``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
hh_demographic[1:3,] %>%
kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),full_width = F)%>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")

```
<br>


* **Campaign_table**
Lists the campaign received by each household.  

``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
campaign_table[1:3,] %>%
kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),full_width = F)%>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")

```

<br>


* **Campaign description**
Describes the length of campaigns. Length affects coupon validity period.  

``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
campaign_desc[1:3,] %>%
kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),full_width = F)%>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")

```

<br>


* **Product Table**
The variable departments represents the fine categories of products. This will be of special interest to our analysis on problem statement # 2, where we will build a customer profile to map customers and their engagement levels with categories.   

``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
product[1:3,] %>%
kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),full_width = F)%>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```
<br>


* **Coupon Table**
Lists all kinds of coupons given as part of various campaigns to customers. Also mentions the kind of products against which the coupons are redeemable. 

``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
coupon[1:3,] %>%
kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),full_width = F)%>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")

```

<br>


* **Coupon Redemption Table**
Lists the coupons that each household/customer redeemed.

``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
coupon_redempt[1:3,] %>%
kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),full_width = F)%>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")

```

<br>


* **Causal Data Table**
Signifies whether each product was featured/advertised in a weekly mailer or in some in-store display.

``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
causal_data[1:3,] %>%
kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),full_width = F)%>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```


<br>
**3.2.3 Peculiarities in the data sets **

<br>
***Missing Values -*** 
``` {r, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}
for (i in seq_along(datasets))
{ 
missing_values<-any(is.na(get(datasets[i])))
if (missing_values)
{
  
  print(paste(datasets[i],"has Missing values"))
} else
  print(paste(datasets[i],"has no Missing values"))
}
```

**Note:**

* We see that there are no missing values in the datasets
* We will again do a missing values analysis and an outlier or abnormal values analysis on our variables of concern, on the datasets that we prepare for our problem statements #1 and #2 (in the next tab)


<br>

**SUMMARY**:

We showed above a glimpse and summary of how all the data from this comprehensive and complex collection look and what they mean. For solving our two research questions the tables that contain variables of interest would be - 

* Transaction data
* Product data
* Demographics data


Refer to tab Data preparation II for more on this and next steps...



### 3.3.Data Preparation - II

**3.3. Data Preparation Steps**

Here we focus on two areas, data preparation (slicing and dicing) for:

* Problem Statement #1
* Problem Statement #2

***Problem Statement #1***


**Tables of concern for Problem #1:**

**3.4. Methodology and Output dataset**

* group the sales_value for each unique household in the transaction dataset
* match those row entries against the unique customers in the demographic dataset
* inner join between the two datasets to have the customer spend and demographic variables for 850 unique customers.

``` {r, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}
#Dataset 1-Demographic factors driving customer spend
Demographic_factors<-group_by(transaction_data,household_key) %>%
 summarise(Total_Sales=sum(sales_value))%>%
 inner_join(hh_demographic,by="household_key")
```

``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
Demographic_factors[1:5,] %>%
kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),full_width = F)%>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")

``` {r, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE,warning = FALSE}
#Dataset 2-Profiling of Customers based on Product Category Engagement
Customer_profile <- inner_join(transaction_data, product, by = "product_id")%>%
  inner_join(product_dpt_mapping, by = "department")%>%
  group_by(household_key, Super_category) %>%
  summarise(Total_Sales = sum(sales_value))%>%
  select(household_key, Super_category, Total_Sales)%>%
  spread(Super_category, Total_Sales)
```


``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
Customer_profile[1:5,] %>%
kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),full_width = F)%>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")


summary(Customer_profile)
```

<br>


**3.5. Variables Summary:**

* ***Dataset-1 : Demographic_factors***

* *Total rows and variables* = `r {dim(Demographic_factors)}` , respectively
* *Variables: household_key* - it has zero missing values, and all unique values signifying distinct customers, 801 in number
* *Total_Sales* - This will be our response variable. This column has no missing values, and data adheres to the possible ranges in the data dsictionary
* *age_desc* - ranges for the variable age of customer ; no missing values ; data as per possible values in data dictionary
* *marital_status* - shows marital status of customers showing three levels. No missing values and no abnormal values either
* *income_desc* - gives possible ranges for the income levels, a factor. No missing values ; no abnormal values either
* *homeowner_desc* - specifies whether homeowner is owner, a renter, etc. A factor variable, with no missing or abnormal values
* *household_size_desc* - a factor variable, specifying the size of a household. No missing values, no abnormal values either
* *kid_category_desc* - no missing values, no abnormal values either



* ***Dataset-2 : Customer_profile***

* *Total rows and variables* = `r {dim(Customer_profile)}` , respectively
* *household_key:* signifies unique household
* *other 19 variables:* these are the 'super categories' that we created by grouping the 44 product categories / departments

**Missing Values** : There are no missing values. However the NA values might give 
the reader the wrong idea. To clarify, for the purposes of our analysis, an ***'NA' would mean zero spending for the particular customer in that particular category. So, the NA values would be imputed with zeroes before starting analysis***



### 4.1.Data Analysis: Problem-1

***4.1 Problem Statement 1-Demographic factors driving customer spend***

* **4.1.1 Analysis**

Here is the main analysis of our first problem statement - What factors primarily affect the total customer spending for our retail client. The analysis is being done on the dataset - 'Demographic_factors'. The reader might remember that this dataset in the one we prepared (using wrangling procedures) in our data preparation sections I and II. The predictor variables being investigated are income_desc, household_size_desc, marital_status_code, and age_desc and all of these are 'factors'  

<br>

To begin with, the analysis "graphically" investigates the possible effects of these variables on the customer spend (Total_Sales). Along with the plots, an interpretation of plots is provided. This is followed by a linear model on the Total_Sales against the four predictor variables, along with interpretations. At the very last of this section, we present a paragraph on the summary/explanation of results.

``` {r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
income <- c("Under 15k", "15-24K", "25-34K", "35-49K", "50-74K", "75-99K", 
            "100-124K", "125-149K", "150-174K", "175-199K", "200-249K")
marital <- c("A", "B", "U")

Demographic_factors$income_desc <- factor(Demographic_factors$income_desc, 
                                          levels = income, ordered = T)

Demographic_factors$marital_status_code <- factor(Demographic_factors$marital_status_code, 
                                          levels = marital, ordered = T)


```


``` {r, echo = TRUE}
Demographic_factors %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Total_Sales, y = income_desc)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Spend vs Income", x = "Spend", y = "Income")

```

**Observation:** We see that the average consumer spend looks to be the highest in the group of $50-74k followed by the groups of $35-49k and $75-99k.

``` {r, echo = TRUE}
Demographic_factors %>%
ggplot(aes(x = Total_Sales, y = age_desc)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Spend vs Age", x = "Spend", y = "Age")

```

**Observation:** It appears that the age bracket of 35-55 years spends the highest compared to all other age groups.


``` {r, echo = TRUE}
Demographic_factors %>%
ggplot(aes(x = Total_Sales, y = household_size_desc,
                                color = marital_status_code)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Spend vs Household Size, and Marital Status", x = "Spend", 
       y = "Household Size")

```

**Observation:** It appears that households with sizes of 2 and 3 would be the highest average spenders, followed by households with sizes 1 and 5. Moreover, it also appears that on average, married customers do spend more as compared to unmarried and single people.

<br>

From the above, we conjecture that a consumer profile who is married, has an household size of 2 to 3, is in the age bracket of 35 to 55, and earns $50-74k annually, will likely be the highest average spender for our client. We explore it a little further though a linear regression model as follows.

<br>

Since all our predictor variables are factors, we take the following steps before running a regression-

* Dummy encoding before running our regression
* Check to make sure our response variable can be reasonably assumed to be normally distributed

``` {r, echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}
# Dummy encoding 

head(model.matrix( ~  age_desc + marital_status_code + income_desc + 
                     household_size_desc, data = Demographic_factors))


```

``` {r, echo = TRUE}
# Regression

model_1 <- lm(Total_Sales ~ age_desc + marital_status_code + 
                           income_desc + household_size_desc, 
                         data = Demographic_factors)
summary(model_1)

```



**Interpretation:** Our linear model results seem to match our initial conjecture (from the graphical investigation) to a great extent. Some of those observations are as follows.

* Age group 35-44 comes out to be statistically significant. Which means that a positive indicator in this age group could have a significant effect (1400 units) on the consumer spend.

* Marital status 'Married' shows statistical significance which has the value of the intercept 5244. Which shows that a positive indicator in this category has a significant effect on consumer spend.

* Income categories "15-24k", "35-49k" and "50-74k" show statistical significance.  With all else constant, a positive indicator in these categories will have a positive effect (combined with the intercept) on the consumer spend.

* Household sizes 3 and 4 have a statistical significance in the model. Which means these have a significant effect on the consumer spend.

<br>

**Summary:** Overall we find that of the four predictor variables studied there are a few categories in each that can largely influence the consumer spend. So we can reasonably conclude that customers are likely to spend more if they fall into the categories under each predictor as mentioned above. Since we get a lesser R-square from the study, we can conjecture that there could be other variables that can possibly help further explain consumer demand variations to different factors


<br>

***4.1.2 Methodology***

**4.1.2.a Preliminary Analysis** - Summaries (*Mean, Median*) across various demographic variables were calculated to understand how spend varies across different levels. Also, we did a graphical investigation to see patterns,  and correlations. 

Once we had some idea about how various variables affect consumer spend, a linear regression model was built to ascertain which variables categories affect spending and how they affect spending.

**4.1.2.b Linear Regression Model** - We built a Linear Regression model using the dataset with all demographic variables and overall sales. Following steps were followed-

*	*Step 1*-Data was collated with all the demographic variables and overall sales over a certain time period for all customers

*	*Step 2*-After checking relationships of variables with overall sales(*Using plots of predictors and sales*), we tested appropriateness for normality of the response variable. And we followed a dummy encoding for all the factor predictor variables.

*	*Step 3*-Once these validations were complete, we ran the linear regression  to calculate estimates for each of the variables and categories

*	*Step 4*-Compare the model iteration using model-fit statistics(*R-square, error*) to arrive at the best model

*	*Step 5*-Calculate the contribution values to understand to what magnitude is sales affected by each of those demographic factors.


<br>


### 4.2.Data Analysis: Problem-2
***4.2 Problem Statement 2-Profiling of Customers based on Product Category Engagement***	

**4.2.1 Data Sources used-**

* Transaction Data
* Product Data

**4.2.2 Business Problem**- Segmenting customers based on spend across various product categories 

**4.2.3 Data Analysis** - 

**4.2.3.a Preliminary Analysis**- Summarize(*mean,median and mode*) the datasets and plot using box-plot graph to identify outliers in spend data. Calculated the range of spend that should be considered after removing outliers. Using plots thus created, identify categories which are more important that others.

**4.2.3.b K-Means Segmentation** - Using sales value across many product departments, K-means segmentation was done to segment customers based on their product needs. Following steps were followed-
 
* **Step 1** - Required columns(*Household ids, Total Sales, Product Categories/Departments*) were pulled from Transaction and Product data after merging them using appropriate columns


*	**Step 2**  - Using the product description information, similar product categories(department) were combined to form broad product categories. *e.g. 'Frozen grocery', 'Produce' and 'Grocery' were all combined under Grocery*

*	**Step 3** - Sales values were rolled up at broad product category level to get total sales for the households

*	**Step 4** -Data was transformed from tall to wide format where columns have total sales for the product categories



``` {r, echo = FALSE,  results = "hide"}
# Using appropropriate product-department mapping getting dollar sales across broad product category and household level  
Cust_profile_data <- suppressWarnings(inner_join(transaction_data,product,by="product_id") %>%
  inner_join(product_dpt_mapping,by="department") %>%
  group_by(household_key,Super_category) %>%
  summarise(Total_Sales=sum(sales_value)) %>%
  select(household_key,Super_category,Total_Sales) %>%
  spread(Super_category,Total_Sales))


```

``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
#Head of the final dataset used for analysis
head(Cust_profile_data) %>%
kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),full_width = F) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```
<br>
``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
#imputing missing values with 0
Cust_profile_data[is.na(Cust_profile_data)] <- 0

#Checking column sums and row sums
Sum_cols <- colSums(Cust_profile_data[2:20],na.rm=TRUE)
Sum_rows <- rowSums(Cust_profile_data[2:20],na.rm=TRUE)
Total_sales <- cbind(Cust_profile_data[1],Total_sales=Sum_rows)
summary(Cust_profile_data[2:20]) %>%
kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),full_width = F) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")




```
<br>
Total sales across product category suggests that biggest product category is Grocery followed by Misc Items and Meat. These 19 variables were taken as input for K-means clustering
``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}

cbind(product=rownames(as.data.frame(Sum_cols)),as.data.frame(Sum_cols))%>%
  arrange(desc(Sum_cols))%>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),full_width = F) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")



```

<br>
Histogram of all 2500 households and their overall spend


``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
#Cheching distribution of all 2500 households to identify outliers
hist(as.double(unlist(Total_sales[2])), breaks = 20, main = "Total Sales across Households", xlab = "Total Sales")
  
```

Checking quantile values to understand what should be the cut-off for analysis.Customers who spent less than $390 in 2 years time were removed from the analysis as we don't have sufficient history for those cases

``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
#Checking quantile values to decide on filter values
quantile(Total_sales$Total_sales,probs = c(0.1,0.5,0.9))
```


```{r}
Total_sales
```


``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
#Filtering out the dataset and leaving all households with insufficient history
Cust_profile_data_filtered <- Total_sales %>%
  filter(Total_sales > 390.00) %>%
  inner_join(Cust_profile_data, by="household_key")
```
<br>
* **Step 5** -Total Sales values were standardized to give similar weightage to all product categories

 

``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
#Getting data in required format to run k-means
df0 <- as.data.frame(scale(Cust_profile_data_filtered[3:21]))
df <- df0[c(8,	13,	12,	4,	15,	3,	9,	6,	2,	11,	7,	1,	14,	5,	19,	17,	18,	10,	16)]
set.seed(123)

head(df) %>%
kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),full_width = F) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```
<br>
* **Step 6** -Decide cluster count such that the total intra-cluster variation(within cluster sum of squares) is minimized. *15 was taken as the optimal cluster count from the graph*

``` {r, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}
# function to compute total within-cluster sum of square 
wss <- function(k) {
  kmeans(df, k, nstart = 10 )$tot.withinss
}
# Compute and plot wss for k = 1 to k = 40
k.values <- 1:40

# extract wss for 1-40 clusters
wss_values <- suppressWarnings(map_dbl(k.values, wss))
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
suppressWarnings(plot(k.values, wss_values,
     type = "b", pch = 19, frame = FALSE, 
     xlab = "Number of clusters K",
     ylab = "Total within-clusters sum of squares"))
```

<br>
* **Step 7** -K-means segmentation was run on the standardized columns to make clusters


``` {r, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}
#running k-means for 15 cluster count
k2 <- suppressWarnings(kmeans(df, centers = 15, nstart = 25))
str(k2)
```

After getting cluster mappind for all 2250 households, data looks like this
``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
head(cbind(k2$cluster,Cust_profile_data_filtered[,c(15,10)]))
```

<br>
* **Step 8** -Visualize the cluster in R to understand how the customers have been clustered



``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
#Plot 1
df1 <- df[1:2]
fviz_cluster(k2, data = df1, labelsize = 1, pointsize = 1)
```
``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
# plot clusters
df1 <- df[1:8]
plot(df1, col = k2$cluster)
```

``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
# plot clusters
df1 <- df[1:3]
plot(df1, col = k2$cluster)
```

<br>
* **Step 9** - Profile and name the clusters based on the average spend across categories. Segments have been named as 'H-Floral-Cosmetics-Garden Supplies buyers' where H represents 'high' total spend and Product categories names suggests the kind of product a customer/household buys(Check Excel)

``` {r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
df_final0<-as.data.frame((Cust_profile_data_filtered[3:21]))
df_final<-df_final0[c(8,	13,	12,	4,	15,	3,	9,	6,	2,	11,	7,	1,	14,	5,	19,	17,	18,	10,	16)]

### 5.Summary

We studied two different problem statements. The summary of both are mentioned below, one after the other.

<br>

**Problem Statement - 1**

***5.1.1 Problem Statement***
The purpose of this study was to understand how the demographic factors like marital status, age, income and household size affect consumer spending. Knowing what demographics make consumers send more during store visits will enable the client's business to be more customer-centric and to ensure better customer lifetime value    

***5.1.2 Methodology***

* **Step 1** Summaries (*Mean, Median*) across various demographic variables were calculated to understand how spend varies across different levels. Also, we did a graphical investigation to see patterns and correlations. Once we had some idea about how various variables affect consumer spend, a linear regression model was built to ascertain which variables categories affect spending and how they affect spending.

* **Step 2** Data was collated with all the demographic variables and overall sales over a certain time period for all customers

*	**Step 3** After checking relationships of variables with overall sales(*Using plots of predictors and sales*), we tested appropriateness for normality of the response variable. And we followed a dummy encoding for all the factor predictor variables.

*	**Step 4** Once these validations were complete, we ran the linear regression  to calculate estimates for each of the variables and categories

*	**Step 5** Compare the model iteration using model-fit statistics(*R-square, error*) to arrive at the best model

*	**Step 6** Calculate the contribution values to understand to what magnitude is sales affected by each of those demographic factors.


***5.1.3 Interesting Insights!***

A key insight we found was regarding the demographic factors that would likely make the consumer  the highest spender at the stores.-

* Consumer spending seems to be highest if consumers are married, have a household size of 2 to 3, earn somewhere between $30-75k, and are between 35 to 45 years of age.


***5.1.4 Project Implications***

We feel that this insight on what demographics make consumers spend more will be key to any decision-making for our retail client. This can be a big enabler in any promotion/coupon targeting programs to various consumer segments or to attract those demographic segments of consumers who currently are not high spenders. Overall, we believe this knowledge is key to ensuring a high average customer lifetime value.  


**Limitations of the analysis**
* This study was limited to the demographic factors we saw in the data. when we ran the regression we found it gave a lower R-square value. We think that there could be other predictor variables that we are not seeing in the data, which might help explain the correlation even better. Variables such as, whether the consumer is a loyal to another retail chain, or whether distance and convenience is a factor how people choose to walk into stores.

**Problem Statement - 2**

***5.2.1 Problem Statement***
The purpose of this study was to get better understanding of our retail client's customers based on product category preferences. It will allow business to get better visibility of the market and customize promotions based on their buying preference. Further, these promotions can help improve the customer interaction level with the store. 
Over time, it will also allow business to keep track of how customers are moving across defined segments and how their preferences change with time



***5.2.2 Methodology***

Using sales value across many product departments, K-means segmentation was done to segment customers based on their product needs. Following steps were followed-
 
* **Step 1** - Required columns(*Household ids, Total Sales, Product Categories/Departments*) were pulled from Transaction and Product data after merging them using appropriate columns

*	**Step 2**  - Using the product description information, similar product categories(department) were combined to form broad product categories. e.g. 'Frozen grocery', 'Produce' and 'Grocery' were all combined under Grocery

*	**Step 3** - Sales values were rolled up at broad product category level to get total sales for the households

*	**Step 4** - Data was transformed from tall to wide format where columns have total sales for the product categories

* **Step 5** - Total Sales values were standardized to give similar weightage to all product categories

* **Step 6** - Decide cluster count such that the total intra-cluster variation(within cluster sum of squares) is minimized

* **Step 7** - K-means segmentation was run on the standardized columns to make clusters

* **Step 8** - Visualize the cluster in R to understand how the customers have been clustered

* **Step 9** -  Profile and name the clusters based on the average spend across categories. Segments have been named as 'H-Floral-Cosmetics-Garden Supplies buyers' where H represents 'high' total spend and Product categories names suggests the kind of product a customer/household buys  

***5.2.3 Intersting Insights!***
Following interesting insights were found in the analysis-

* Among the high spenders, there is a segment  'H-Floral-Cosmetics-Garden Suplies buyers'  with 67 households and it seems to be buying products from floral, cosmetics and garden supplies. We can target this segment using cross-category promotions across these product categories to increase their engagement level. Also, in case sales of any of these product categories is dropping, sales across this customer segment should be checked for any potential reasons.

* Majority of the customers(~1230) belong to the *"VL-Grocery-Basic Necessities"* segment who visit stores for the basic necessities (groceries/basic necessities).Majority of the money is spent on buying on grocery(~61%) followed by Misc Items(17%) and meat(14%)

* Another important segment is "L-Broad category Spenders" with 639 customers. These customers spend on broad categories ranging from Grocery, Deli, Meat , Services and coupons to less common 

***5.2.4 Project Implications***
Earlier promotions were sent out to household without much consideration of customer/household profile and the buying potential. So, the promotions were not customized for the audience and were sent to all irrespective of their preferences 
New segmentation exercise would allow business to send targeted messages and enable them to design promotional strategies in a better way. For eg. If the store wants to promote new automotive product in the store, it should be sending the promotional e-mail to all households part of segment 15 *"L-Automotive Products"* as these are the households who have bought products from this category. Also, knowing how your sales is distributed across categories will allow stores to come up with cross-category promotions aimed at increasing customer spend.

**Limitations of the analysis**
Following are the few limitations and few factors which could be included to get improve the quality of segments in the future-

*	We can club some of the segments which have very few households present in them like segment 4,14,7,12 and 13

*	Broad product categories created after combining similar departments could be clubbed further to get fewer dimensions relevant for our business problem. Also, current definition can be further validated to ensure that mapping used is correct as per business requirement

*	Other variables like frequency of visits should be included in the analysis which would give us better idea about the buying pattern and would make household segments more useful for this kind of study
